      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My goal as a creative coder is to build websites, applications, plugins, and extensions that solve problems and empower consumers, hobbyists, researchers, analysts, academics, and governments.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally I'm from Syracuse, New York but have since lived in New Haven, Connecticut for 5 years while attending Yale University as an undergrad. Currently I reside in Denver, Colorado.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm an avid laccrosse player, golfer, and NFL football fan. I've been alpine skiing since the age of 3 and enjoy the challenging terrain Colorado presents. Additionally, I love to be outdoors by or in a body of water when I'm not on the slopes! I also enjoy a wide range of musical genres and occasionally attend live music events.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To create, oversee, and scale one of my software brain children into a valued and successful business. Otherwise, a data driven NFL GM would be very exciting!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Denver, Colorado</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to use the skills developed as a web developer to bridge the gap between my creative instinct and the necessary action items to make them a reality.</p>
